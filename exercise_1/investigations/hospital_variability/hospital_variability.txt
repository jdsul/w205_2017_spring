Question 3: Which procedures have the greatest variability between hospitals?

***Note, I know I didn't get the right answer for this question because my effective care was losing about half the rows when I put it into HDFS. Going through both my load data lake file and my hive_base_ddl file I couldn't figure out why that was happening. The below results are for what I did get.***

To figure out what procedures had the most variability between hospitals we just need to figure out what procedures have the most variability in general, since the data is at the hospital level already the most variable procedures overall should be the most variable procedures between hospitals.

The first thing I did was to clone the effective care table but I removed all rows where the score was not an integer. There are some rows that instead have values that indicate number of procedures and others just say not available. 

After dropping those rows I created another table that calculated the average and standard deviation of the scores for each measure ID. I then created a third table that was identical to the second table except it also contains a ratio of the standard deviation to the mean for each measure ID. 

I will use that ratio to determine the most variable measures. I use the ratio instead of the just standard deviation because there's not a single set scale that all the scores adhere to. Different measures are measured and recorded differently so they can't be compared apples to apples. The ratio of standard deviation to mean normalizes all the different scores so they can be directly compared. 

Using this method the 10 most variable measures are:

VTE_6   Hospital acquired potentially preventable venous thromboembolism        1.94	4.74	2.44
PC_01	Percent of newborns whose deliveries were scheduled early (1-3 weeks early), when a scheduled delivery was not medically necessary	2.29	4.38	1.91
OP_22	Left before being seen	1.79	1.77	0.99
OP_20	Door to diagnostic eval	25.83	18.22	0.71
ED_2b	ED2	100.49	64.62	0.64
OP_5	Median Time to ECG	8.31	5.31	0.64
OP_3b	Median Time to Transfer to Another Facility for Acute Coronary Intervention	58.33	32.41	0.56
OP_1	Median Time to Fibrinolysis	26.3	11.88	0.45
ED_1b	ED1	276.97	103.98	0.38
OP_31	Improvement in Patientï¿½s Visual Function within 90 Days Following Cataract Surgery	85.14	29.27	0.34
